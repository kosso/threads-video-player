# Better threads Video

-----------------

After getting thoroughly irritated and annoyed by the desktop threads experience when it comes to their video player, I decided to have a go at replacing them with the standard browser player using a Chrome Extension. 


----------------


### Installation

- Clone this repo. 
- In Chrome : Click the three-dot-menu in the top right corner. 
- Go to Extensions > Manage Extensions. 
- Click 'Load Unpacked' and point to the root of the cloned repo. 

- Voila. Reload Threads on desktop Chrome and you should no longer have auto playing videos ehich use a player with no flippin' controls.
-----------------

This solution is not perfect, as there are times a video might start again after you've watched it. This is due to Meta shoving the worst 'dark patterns' onto Threads when it comes to video playback. This will be due their experience with Instagram and other video platforms where the user is treated like a bloody idiot.  

-----------------

For context, these are the steps you currently have to go through in order to simply watch a video you're actually interested in watching (and heariing), from the start. 

- See video (Already autoplaying. Muted)
- Decide to watch video.
- Click video to expand.
- Peck around to try and rewind it.
- Finally discover a way to rewind it.
- Realise it's still muted.
- Click unmute.
- Peck around the tiny scrub bar to rewind again.
- Watch video.
- Close video.
- Realise it's still looping.
- Click Mute.
- Scroll the now muted, still playing video away from view.

### IT'S SO PAINFUL!!!
